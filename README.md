JavaEE 8
Payara Server
H2 Database

This application will allow the user to register a username and password which will be saved to a database under a table called ForumUsers, and posting messages
on the home page which are saved to a table called ForumPosts.

The code does not work, i am unable to read or write data to my tables. Cleans and builds properly and deploys without fail.

**Might be a problem with the persistence.xml file
